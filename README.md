Hello

In the next two months, I want to build software that...

is easy to use, useful and/or helpful, helps me learn, and serves a purpose. 

I would enjoy building software that could help students, possibly an app that can solve geometric equations. 
I would enjoy for it to have a sleek interface that looks attractive while still serving it's purpose.
I would like to find a way that students could find this app useful.
I would like for it to be free as many apps like this cost because their creators are too selfish to see the greater good.
I would also like for the app to display the equations so students could also use the app as a quick reference guide when studying for tests and quizzes.
